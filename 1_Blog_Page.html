        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>
            Let’s talk about a fun variable concept. If we create a variable called "iplSeason" to represent the current season of IPL, 
            we can easily display it on the page or use it in calculations for upcoming seasons. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Current IPL Season: </strong><span id="iplSeason"></span></p>
        <script>
            var iplSeason = 2025; // Current IPL season
            document.getElementById("iplSeason").innerText = iplSeason;
        </script>
